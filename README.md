## Main Steps

### 1. Data Preparation
- Transformation of the original dataset (**Year + Month â†’ Date**)  
- Creation of a `tsibble` object

### 2. Exploratory Analysis
- Identification of **trend**, **seasonality**, and **variance**

### 3. Statistical Transformations
- Application of **square root transformation**  
- **Box-Cox Transformation**  
- Seasonal and first-order differencing to achieve **stationarity**

### 4. Modeling
- Comparison of different **ARIMA/SARIMA** models  
- Selection based on **AICc**

### 5. Validation
- Diagnostics of **residuals**  
- Statistical tests: **ADF** (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) and **Ljung-Box**

### 6. Forecasting
- Split between **training (2002â€“2021)** and **testing (2022â€“2023)**  
- Conclusion that the most suitable model was:  
  **ARIMA(2,1,2)(0,1,2)[12]**
